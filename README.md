# Argsposer
I needed to debug arguments and data passed/piped into a program.  This is
the easiest way to do that.  It's a C# program that dumps its arguments
(with indices) and all data piped into it.  Perfect for checking links with
"Open With...", checking formatting of interprocess data (rename it to
whatever target you like!), and countless other uses.
